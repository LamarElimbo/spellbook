On casting the witches strength, dexterity and constitution are boosted by +1 for every success level of the magic roll. It lasts for an hour per success level of the spell.

408,"Blocking Spell          Effect: Drags some sort of existing obstacle between the user and an approaching attack. This is almost sort of a Telekinetic reflexive defense. Of course, it's only useful if a. the caster knows about the attack and b. he/she gets it off before the attack takes place (wins Initiative.)

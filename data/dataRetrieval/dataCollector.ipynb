      "Spell: Wasting Death          Effect: This spell causes the victim to be afflicted by a wasting disease that will first atrophy the muscles and decalcify the bones, then weaken the organs, and finally cause the victim to shrivel up like a prune and croak. Depending upon the victim's health, this could take anywhere from a few hours to several weeks, during which time the spell can be reversed.         Power level determined as follows: effect = Major +3, Target = One person +1, Duration = long +3\n",
      "Name: Revoke Invitation          This spell undoes an invitation into a home, making it impossible for a vampire to enter until he is again invited.\n",

She is still a vampire, but has all the goodies that go along with humanity such as conscience, guilt, and remorse. This spell alone will not impose a bat effect is reserved for the original spell, which has presumably been lost over the ages.         Power Level is determined as follows: People Affected (one person = +1), Effect Strength (Awesome = +5), Duration (Permanent = +3), Spell Requirements (Way-Rare Ingredients = -3)\n",
      "Name: Flame of Life          Effect: This creates a living flame which can burn and destroy any object. The fire is invoked in an urn or other container, which it cannot spread out of (assuming the spell is cast correctly). To create it requires several special powders which must be prepared. By casting the powders into an ordinary fire while chanting, the living flame is produced.\n",
      "Name: Lightning of Myhnegon          This spell requires the Glove of Myhnegon. It takes some time for a storm to gather and lightning bolt called down into the glove. However, after that point, the caster can cast lightning by a simple gesture and the phrase \"Tauo freim!\".\n",

      "Name: Zombie Creation          This calls a zombie back from the grave. The spell is invoked while dangling a chicken foot over the grave of the person. The caster then must spill some of his living blood onto the grave earth. It can only work when the \"stars are aligned\" which happens perhaps once every year (Jack O'Toole had to wait 8 months for it to happen from when his friends died).\n",
      "Name: Hebron's Binding          This is a powerful protection spell which is used to bind a demon. It was found in Hebron's Almanac, and was used to bind the Hellmouth demon. It is invoked from a black circular figure painted on the floor. Eight rays extend from the edge. Inside are four small semicircles which mark the four corners. At the center three short lines intersect. A lit candle stands on each line and a fourth at their intersection. All around the circle and the room are more candles.\n",
      "Name: Eryishon's Spell of Recall          This opens a temporal fold to put or return something or someone to an alternate timeline. The caster calls upon the Eryishon, The Endless One, and pours sacred sand over the representation of the object, and Eryishon brings it forth from the time and place it was lost. The object may be anything from a lost necklace to a vampiric twin.         Power Level is determined as follows: People Affected (Noticeable = +1), Effect Strength (Major = +3), Duration (Permanent = +3), Spell Requirements (Unusual Ingredients = -1).\n",

      "Name: Instant Cool          An augmentation spell that turns the sorcerer into a sort of paragon - the best of everything, everyone's ideal. The spellcaster's stats are automatically put up to Experienced Hero level, or higher, at Director's discretion, and Qualities or Drawbacks, especially those of Nerd or Misfit, must be reviewed and exchanged for more \"acceptible\" ones of equal value, such as Adversary (required), Dependent or Honorable, while the spellcaster is a paragon. The sorcerer must take a mark upon his or her body as part of the ritual. It is an ancient symbol from an unknown race, and is permanent, staying on the spell caster until the spell is broken.         But there's another type of drawback. In order to balance the new force of good, the spell has to create the opposing force of evil - the worst of everything, everyone's nightmare. The creature will have attributes and stats of equal standing with the spellcaster's improved stats, and the well-being of this creature is linked to the sorcerer. It becomes the sorcerer's Adversary, attempting to attack him, and anyone else in it's way. It will wear the same mark as the spellcaster. If it is injured, the sorcerer reduces the boost in his or her Attributes and Life Points by half, and if it dies, the spell is broken and the sorcerer reverts to whatever he was before.         Additionally, if an inexperienced spellcaster casts this (Sorcery level 1 or 2), the magics won't last longer than an episode (if not dispelled before then), and major side effects will happen as the spell corrodes. This could cause a physical or temporal breach, summon a powerful entity, or other terrible side effect, at the Director's discretion.         Power level determined as follows: Duration (Permanent = +3), People Affected (Awesome = +5), Effect Strength (Major = +3).\n",

      "Name: Force of Will          This is a spell for a spellcaster to have her will done. It can be extremely powerful, but is difficult to control. While it is in effect, with just a few heart-felt words the caster can blind a person, control loves, and many other effects. It can be undone with the invocation: \"Let the healing power begin. Let my will be safe again. As these words of peace are spoken, let this harmful spell be broken.\n",

      "Name: Ritual of Joining          Effect: The participants of this spell add their stats to the stats of the targeted Slayer. For example, Buffy would have a Strength of 15, Willpower of 19, Occultism of 20, and a Getting Medieval of 21. In addition to Attributes and Skills, also add the participants' Qualities at your discretion (Sorcery and Hard to Kill would be appropriate while Attractiveness would be very out of place). Also roll a D10 and add half the total to each stat to represent the power of the Slayers of the past lending their power. Note that the use of this spell might will attract the attention of the Spirit of the Slayer. The Director should feel free to use this as he sees fit.         Power Level is determined as follows: People Affected (2-10 = +2), Effect Strength (Awesome = +5), Duration (One minute per Success Level = 0), Spell Requirements (No Special Requirements), Limited Target Selection (Slayer = -1).\n",
      "Spell: Adamanteus Aer (Steel Air)          Effect: This spell causes the air to harden into a barrier as strong as an inch of steel plate, the barrier is approximately 20 feet high and wide and is invisible unless touched (in which case the air seems to \"ripple\"), if cast in a smaller space the barrier will re-size itself. The barrier lasts for one minute per success level of the spell. The spell can be cast anywhere within 100 feet of the caster but it will only cast in open space it can not displace living or inert matter. This spell is useful for both blocking the escape of fleeing foes or providing a barrier for a hasty retreat.         Power level determined as follows: Effect (Major = +3), Target (None = 0), Duration (Medium = 0).\n",
      "Name: Fist of Air          This spell strikes the target with a physical force of solidified air. It not only does damage, but also throws the target a considerable distance (as it did when Willow used it to launch Glory away from them).\n",
      "Name: Protective Wall          This is the spell that Willow used to protect them from the Knights.\n",

      "Name: Tabula Rasa Level 1          Effect: The target of this spell loses a specific memory. They go about their lives as if the specified event had never happened. If they are made aware of their lost memories, though, they may roll their Perception + Occultism with a difficulty of 9 + the number of success levels of the original spell to regain their lost memory.         Power Level is determined as follows: People Affected (One Person = +1, increase if more than one target by the appropriate amount), Effect Strength (Minor = +1), Duration (Permanent = +3), Spell Requirements (No Special Requirements).\n",
      "Name: Tabula Rasa Level 2          Effect: The target(s) of this spell loose all memories related to a specific event or emotion. This spell is used to erase an event from the not-so-recent past, such as Buffy being in heaven, as well as the emotions and memories associated with it. Targeted memories will be lost after the crystal turns black (approximately a half hour). These memories will only return if the crystal is broken.         Power Level is determined as follows: People Affected (One person = +1, increase if more than one target by the appropriate amount), Effect Strength (Severe = +3), Duration (Permanent = +3), Spell Requirements (No Special Requirements).\n",
      "Name: Lagomorpic Summoning          Effect: This spell summons rabbits. It's one of those incantations which \"wants to be cast,\" however, and doesn't seem to even drain the user. Unwary sorcerers can inadvertantly create a veritable pit of cotton-top hell with this one. GMs are invited to be creative when dealing with abuse of this spell.         Power level is determined as follows: People Affected (One Rabbit, +1); Effect Strength (Severe, +2); Duration (Meaningless); Spell Requirements (No Special Requirements)\n",

      "Name: .... \n",
      "Name: Blessing of Shamash          Effect: The target of this spell is shielded from magical damage. Each time the chant is completed, the target gains a \"magical buffer\" equal to double to caster's willpower. This effect is cumulative as long as the spell is continuously chanted.         Power Level is determined as follows: People Affected (None = 0, One Person = +1, 2-10 People = +2), Effect Strength (Severe = +2), Duration (Short = -1), Special Requirements (No special requirements).\n",
      "Name: Strength of Magic          Effect: This spell grants the caster superhuman physical abilities. On casting the witches strength, dexterity and constitution are boosted by +1 for every success level of the magic roll. It lasts for an hour per success level of the spell. Failure to gain the required success levels can have extremely unpleasant effects as the spell reduces the casters LP by 10 for every level the caster is short of the required number of success levels, the spell will also have no beneficial effect on the casters physical abilities.         Example: Dark Willow (occult 8, willpower 5, sorcery 9) has decided that the best way to overcome her grief at Tara's passing is to beat a couple of nerds into a pulpy paste. She rolls her magic bonus (8+5+5)=18 and spends a drama point for +10 to the roll which comes up an 7 for a total of 35 (gulp) thats 10 success levels. Mild mannered Willow's stats jump up to Strength: 11, Dexterity: 12, Constitution: 13.         Power level is determined as follows: People Affected (One Person, +1); Effect Strength (Severe x3, +5); Duration (long, +1); Spell Requirements (No Special Requirements).\n",
      "Name: Flounder Opponent          Effect: Pretty much just knocks someone off their feet and disorients them. In combat, the victim spends a turn regaining his footing and bearings. This comes in handy when your enemy is trying to shoot you with a crossbow, or when you just want to embarass that obnoxious cheerleader during halftime. Any damage is incidental (get her while she's at the top of the human pyramid.)         Power level is determined as follows: People Affected (One Person, +1); Effect Strength (Minor); Duration (Meaningless); Spell Requirements (No Special Requirements)\n",
      "Name: Binding Field          Effect: Paralyzes the subject within a nifty ring of shimmering force. The spell reduces the victims Willpower and Dexterity by one per Success Level. Subjects reduced to -2 Dexterity or below are paralyzed, subjects reduced to -2 Willpower or below are unable to use magic or Telekinesis. Characters bound in such a field may be able to exert enough force of will (one Drama Point) to communicate (verbally or mentally) for a short period of time. Note that Giles probably used a Drama Point to put this one on Willow as well as he did, and Willow almost certainly used a couple to get Anya to release her from it.         Power level is determined as follows: People Affected (One Person, +1); Effect Strength (Two Severe Effects, +3); Duration (Permanent [Or Until Dispelled Or Cancelled], +3); Spell Requirements (No Special Requirements)         Special Note: Willow uses a simple incantation (\"Solutum,\" or \"to loosen; to untie , release, free; to dissolve, break up; to exempt; to break up, weaken, bring to an end; to pay off, discharge a debt\" in Latin) to dispell this effect the second time Giles tries to use it on her. \"Solvo\" and \"Libero\" (\"to set free, liberate, release, exempt\" in Latin) apparently weren't the right counterspells for this one.\n",
      "Name: Blocking Spell          Effect: Drags some sort of existing obstacle between the user and an approaching attack. This is almost sort of a Telekinetic reflexive defense. Of course, it's only useful if a. the caster knows about the attack and b. he/she gets it off before the attack takes place (wins Initiative.) It also assumes the availability of a suitable obstacle (a combat practice dummy, a dresser, a manequin, a corpse, rare antiques, etc.) The spell (deliberately) won't directly affect people, so innocent bystanders need not apply. How much protection is offered depends on what's available.         Power level is determined as follows: Due to the limitations on this spell, it really only merits a Power Level of 1. It's mostly a reflexive activation of the casters own Telekinesis ability.\n",
      "Name: Hammer of Govannon          Effect: A simple bolt of pure force, in the form of a glowing mass of energy slamming into the target. The force of this attack is kinetic, and can do such neat stuff as pulverize things or throw people back through brick walls. Do not cast in glass houses. Does five times Willpower points of damage per Success Level.         Power level is determined as follows: People Affected (One Person = +1); Effect Strength (Awsome = +5), calculating from Giles' scores, he would have needed this power level with his average of five Success Levels to throw Willow back through a brick wall and half a concrete support); Duration (Meaningless); Spell Requirements (No Special Requirements).\n",
